# PowerBI-Portfolio
A portfolio of my PowerBI dashboards, reports and projects.

**About Me**

I am a recent graduate with past experience in software engineering and data analysis. I have began
to utilize Power BI as a tool to create data insights and visualizations. Below are a few of the projects I have been
working on lately!

**Project One - Retail Analysis Dashboard (Direct Managers)**

A dashboard created with the intention of analyzing a retail store's success focusing on
insights by specific direct manager. How are certain managers performing? Are they meeting their
goals? This dashboard displays this information and more.
